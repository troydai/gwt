# GWT: Git Worktree Management

## Overview

GWT is a CLI tool designed to simplify Git worktree management and reduce operational overhead. As AI-driven development becomes more common, the need for multiple concurrent work environments within a single repository has increased. Git worktrees provide a lightweight alternative to full repository clones, but the native command set can be cumbersome, requiring manual directory navigation and lacking centralized organization.

GWT streamlines this workflow by providing a unified interface for creating, navigating, and managing worktrees, optimizing the experience for both developers and AI agents.

## Status

This project is currently under active development.

## Planned Features

- **Centralized Configuration**: Define a root directory for all worktrees.
- **Automated Navigation**: Seamlessly switch between worktrees with automatic directory changing.
- **Rapid Lifecycle Management**: Efficient commands for creating and deleting worktrees.
- **AI Integration**: Streamlined workflow to initialize a worktree and invoke an AI agent in a single step.
